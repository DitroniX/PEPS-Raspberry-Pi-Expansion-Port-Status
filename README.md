### Introduction

Remove the need dig through the component box and attach LEDs, Logic probe or fire up the Scope just to quickly check any GPIO pin output status.

**PEPS** simple to use Pi Expansion Port Status monitor board will assist with instant visual information on all GPIO ports and is exactly what you need!

**PEPS** is a Raspberry Pi Expansion Port Status monitor board, with an LED on each port, that is neatly packaged in a compact PiHat mechanical size.

### Specification and Features

-   Super easy to use and compact **PEPS** board is great to quicky and instantly see what ports are high, or low
-   Designed to fit on any Raspberry Pi and be left in place as a side PiHat, or temporarily placed over the Raspberry Pi Pin Header for fast GPIO debugging
-   Each Raspberry Pi GPIO port has a very low current 5mA LED, so not to affect the pin state and minimize current.
-   GPIO port LEDs are group coloured to assist with fast and instant identification of a GPIO type and status
-   Power 5V and 3V3 LEDS to confirm supplies are up on all four power pins. This is also ideal for other clones of the Raspberry Pi.
-   The **PEPS** board is the same size as a Pi Zero (65 x 30mm)
-   **PEPS** is self powered from the individual GPIO outputs

The underside of the **PEPS** board has a convenient quick lookup of all the Raspberry Pi Pins, Power and GPIOs
